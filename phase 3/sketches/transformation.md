# Data Transformation Sketch
Since most of these tasks are code-based, a picture isn't going to be very useful here. Instead, I will block out the tasks that need to be done.

- Determine and calculate a metric for "most affected by climate change"
- transform yearly emissions by country to cumulative emissions for each year for each country
- transform climate disasters into a form that's good for plotting (ocurrences are sparse, so a 5-year rolling average or something is probably better- maybe graph different options)
